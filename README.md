# Theory and Equations for [Application Name]

## Introduction
This application models [problem description]. The primary goal is to solve [main challenge]. The mathematical formulation is based on the following equations.

## Governing Equations
The governing equations are derived from [physical laws, e.g., Navier-Stokes equations, Darcy's law]. The equations are as follows:

1. **Mass Conservation:**
   \[
   \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{u}) = 0
   \]

2. **Momentum Conservation:**
   \[
   \rho \frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + \rho (\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla) \mathbf{u} = -\nabla p + \mu \nabla^2 \mathbf{u}
   \]

## Assumptions
The model assumes:
- Incompressible flow
- Negligible inertial forces
