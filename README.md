Navier-Stokes Cahn-Hilliard (NSCH) for MOOSE Framework
=====

The MOOSE Navier-Stokes Cahn-Hilliard (NSCH) application is a library for implementing simulation tools that solve the Navier-Stokes Cahn-Hilliard equations with non-matching densities using Galerkin finite element methods with a residual-based stabilization scheme.

# MOOSE Framework

The Multiphysics Object-Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE) is a finite-element, multiphysics framework primarily developed by [Idaho National Laboratory](https://inl.gov/). It provides a high-level interface to some of the most sophisticated nonlinear solver technology on the planet. MOOSE presents a straightforward API that aligns well with the real-world problems scientists and engineers need to tackle. Every detail about how an engineer interacts with MOOSE has been thought through, from the installation process through running your simulation on state of the art supercomputers, the MOOSE system will accelerate your research.

Some of the capabilities enabled by MOOSE:

- Fully-coupled, fully-implicit multiphysics solver
- Dimension independent physics
- Automatically parallel (largest runs >100,000 CPU cores!)
- Modular development simplifies code reuse
- Built-in mesh adaptivity
- Continuous and Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) (at the same time!)
- Intuitive parallel multiscale solves (see videos below)
- Dimension agnostic, parallel geometric search (for contact-related applications)
- Flexible, pluggable graphical user interface
- Approximately 30 pluggable interfaces allow specialization of every part of the solve
